Titanic Dataset Analysis
1. Dataset Loading
  •	Imported and loaded the Titanic dataset using Jupyter Notebook.
  •	Checked the basic structure
2. Missing Values Analysis
  •	Visualized missing values using a heatmap to identify columns with null data.
3. Distribution Analysis
  •	Performed distribution analysis on key numerical and categorical columns:
    o	Age: Overall distribution and its effect on survival.
    o	Age vs Fare by Survival: Compared age and fare with survival outcomes.
    o	Gender vs Survival: Analyzed survival rates by gender.
    o	Survival rate by Parch: Checked the relationship between number of parents/children aboard and survival.
4. Relationship Analysis
  •	Identified correlations between numerical columns using a heatmap to detect relationships and multicollinearity.
5. Grouping and Aggregation
   •	Calculated survival rates based on categorical measures:
   o	Survival rate by gender
   o	Survival rate by passenger class (Pclass)
   o	Survival rate by number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)
6. Outlier Detection
  •	Identified outliers in numerical columns using boxplots and statistical methods.
7. Skewness and Transformation
  •	Analyzed skewness of numerical variables.
  •	Applied visualizations and log transformations where necessary to normalize skewed distributions.
